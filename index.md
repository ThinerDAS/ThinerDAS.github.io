# Hello everyone

I am ThinerDAS, a magic tower lover and a hacking apprentice.

I have been playing CTF since my freshman year (2015). I am interested in methods to improve the CTF skill of myself and my team, [Never Stop Exploiting](https://ctftime.org/team/13575).

## Git repositories

See my writeups [here](https://github.com/ThinerDAS/writeup).

See my grasp on OISC [here](https://github.com/ThinerDAS/subl).

See my old thought on magic tower AI [here](https://github.com/ThinerDAS/dasstudio2016).

New CTF player who finds writing CTF problems hard may try [this](https://github.com/ThinerDAS/what-is-ctf).
